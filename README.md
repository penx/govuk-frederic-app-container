# GOV.UK Frederic AppContainer

Work in progress React component that provides an application container to a given set of React modules.

The container plans to:

- provide a top nav, with a link to each module
- given an api endpoint, fetch reference data via redux or the context api
- read feature flags passed from the server and provide them to modules as props via render props
- Provide a Toast notification system
